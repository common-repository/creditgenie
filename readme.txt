Enable the ability for your customers to pay for their purchase over time with equal installments.

== Description ==

The CreditGenie solution enables you to extend financing to your customers so they can pay for their online purchase over time in equal instalments. A quick process and instant approvals ensures that your customers can complete the transaction seamlessly and benefit from the affordability of splitting the purchase amount into smaller periodic payments.

When your customer chooses the CreditGenie option at checkout they will be redirected to the CreditGenie website to complete our application. After completing all the required steps, the customer would be automatically transferred to the order confirmation page of your online store.
